## ECEN5833 Low Power Embedded Firmware Development Project

Practically learn physical design techniques to develop a battery and energy harvested powered radio networked device for consumer, industrial, and high reliability applications. Through this project, we explored the engineering tradeoffs and made decisions on energy sources, energy storage devices, power supplies, radio networks, micro controllers, and sensors. Over the course of the semester, we went through design concept, design architecture, schematic entry, board layout design, PCB manufacturing, PCB assembly, test, debug, and verification.
